Usage: python ./build_database.py 

The purpose of this code is to create a database with an assumed seven 
rankings in "The Flavor Bible" and related literature for the strengths
of flavor combinations:

 0. The source ingredient
 1. *BOLD CAPS (with asterisk): "Holy Grail" flavor combination
   e.g. Basil and Garlic
 2. BOLD CAPS: highly recommended
   e.g. Basil and Olive Oil
 3. bold: frequently recommended
   e.g. Basil and Lemon
 4. normal: known to work well together
   e.g. Basil and Black Pepper
 5. not mentioned
   e.g. Basil and Walnuts
-1. AVOID: known to not work well together
   e.g. Basil and Tarragon

So, while 
    basil + garlic + olive oil + Parmesan cheese + pine nuts
is a natural flavor affinity (i.e. pesto), 
    basil + garlic + olive oil + lemon + black pepper + walnut
also has strong flavor affinity and in my experience makes a 
wonderfully fine pesto, too, esp. in grilled chicken wraps.  

It would be good to visualize paths between ingredients that 
one might have on hand, or that might be in season together, 
or explore what's common between two cuisines--e.g. Thai, 
Mexican, and Italian all have paths between each other but we 
don't see their fusions as frequently as we do with Brazilian and 
Japanese or French and Creole which have clear culturally historic 
blending.  Can we predict ingredient pathways between African and 
Chinese cuisines based on nontrivial ingredients the same way, say, 
Indian curries might interface with British cuisine today?   

The overall purpose of this project is to first create a machine 
readable database (from the various book's epub files) of flavor 
compatablities and then create an input system so that a chef 
can either visualize graphs of possible (new) flavor combinations 
given several input ingredients or so, so that she may learn 
and interactively chart a course in recipe creation.
